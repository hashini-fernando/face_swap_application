# Multi-Angle Face Swap App (Streamlit + InsightFace)

This project is a **Streamlit web app** that performs **AI-powered face swapping** while preserving **head pose and facial angles**.  
It uses **InsightFace**, **OpenCV**, and **ONNXRuntime** to detect, analyze, and swap faces from uploaded or live webcam images.

##  Features

- Face detection and embedding extraction using **InsightFace (buffalo_l)**  
- Realistic face swapping via **inswapper_128.onnx**  
- Angle-based matching (yaw/pitch/roll)  
- 3D head pose visualization  
- Live camera or image upload options  
- Quality metrics (PSNR, SSIM, Identity Similarity)  
- Download swapped results  
- Clean Streamlit dashboard UI
